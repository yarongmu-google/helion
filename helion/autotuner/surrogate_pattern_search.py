    """
    Batch Likelihood-Free Bayesian Optimization (LFBO) Pattern Search.

    This algorithm enhances PatternSearch by using a Random Forest classifier as a surrogate
    model to select which configurations to benchmark, reducing the number of
    kernel compilations and runs needed to find optimal configurations.
    It imposes a similarity penalty to encourage diverse config selection.

    Algorithm Overview:
        1. Generate an initial population (random or default) and benchmark all configurations
        2. Fit a Random Forest classifier to predict "good" vs "bad" configurations:
           - Configs with performance < quantile threshold are labeled as "good" (class 1)
           - Configs with performance >= quantile threshold are labeled as "bad" (class 0)
           - Weighted classification emphasize configs that are much better than the threshold
        3. For each generation:
           - Generate random neighbors around the current best configurations
           - Score all neighbors using the classifier's predicted probability of being "good"
           - Penalizes points that are similar to previously selected points
           - Selects points to benchmark via sequential greedy optimization
           - Retrain the classifier on all observed data (not incremental)
           - Update search trajectories based on new results

    The weighted classification model learns to identify which configs maximize
    expected improvement over the current best config. Compared to fitting a surrogate
    to fit the config performances themselves, since this method is based on classification,
    it can also learn from configs that timeout or have unacceptable accuracy.

    Args:
        kernel: The kernel to be autotuned.
        args: The arguments to be passed to the kernel during benchmarking.
        initial_population: Number of random configurations in initial population.
            Default from PATTERN_SEARCH_DEFAULTS. Ignored when using DEFAULT strategy.
        copies: Number of top configurations to run pattern search from.
            Default from PATTERN_SEARCH_DEFAULTS.
        max_generations: Maximum number of search iterations per copy.
            Default from PATTERN_SEARCH_DEFAULTS.
        min_improvement_delta: Early stopping threshold. Search stops if the relative
            improvement abs(best/current - 1) < min_improvement_delta.
            Default: 0.001 (0.1% improvement threshold).
        frac_selected: Fraction of generated neighbors to actually benchmark, after
            filtering by classifier score. Range: (0, 1]. Lower values reduce benchmarking
            cost but may miss good configurations. Default: 0.15.
        num_neighbors: Number of random neighbor configurations to generate around
            each search point per generation. Default: 300.
        radius: Maximum perturbation distance in configuration space. For power-of-two
            parameters, this is the max change in log2 space. For other parameters,
            this limits how many parameters can be changed. Default: 2.
        quantile: Threshold for labeling configs as "good" (class 1) vs "bad" (class 0).
            Configs with performance below this quantile are labeled as good.
            Range: (0, 1). Lower values create a more selective definition of "good".
            Default: 0.3 (top 30% are considered good).
        patience: Number of generations without improvement before stopping
            the search copy. Default: 2.
        similarity_penalty: Penalty for selecting points that are similar to points
            already selected in the batch. Default: 1.0.
        initial_population_strategy: Strategy for generating the initial population.
            FROM_RANDOM generates initial_population random configs.
            FROM_BEST_AVAILABLE uses cached configs from prior runs, and fills the
            remainder with random configs when best_available_pad_random is True.
            Can be overridden by HELION_AUTOTUNER_INITIAL_POPULATION env var.

    LFBO Tree Search: Likelihood-Free Bayesian Optimization with tree-guided neighbor generation.

    This algorithm uses a Random Forest classifier as a surrogate model to both
    select which configurations to benchmark and to guide the generation of new
    candidate configurations via greedy decision tree traversal.

    Algorithm Overview:
        1. Generate an initial population (random or default) and benchmark all configurations
        2. Fit a Random Forest classifier to predict "good" vs "bad" configurations:
           - Configs with performance < quantile threshold are labeled as "good" (class 1)
           - Configs with performance >= quantile threshold are labeled as "bad" (class 0)
           - Weighted classification emphasizes configs that are much better than the threshold
        3. For the first generation, generate neighbors via random perturbation
           since the surrogate is not yet fitted
        4. For subsequent generations, generate neighbors via greedy tree traversal:
           a. For each of num_neighbors trials:
              - Pick a random decision tree from the Random Forest
              - Trace the decision path for the current best config through that tree
              - Extract the configuration parameters used in the tree's split decisions
              - For each parameter on the path, greedily optimize it:
                  * Generate pattern_neighbors within the configured radius
                  * Score candidates using the single tree's predicted probability
                  * Accept the best value (ties broken randomly) and incrementally
                    update the encoded representation
              - Keep the result only if it differs from the base configuration
           b. Score candidates using the full ensemble's predicted probability
              with a diversity-aware similarity penalty, then select top candidates
        5. Benchmark selected candidates, retrain the classifier on all observed data

    The tree-guided traversal focuses search on parameters the surrogate has identified
    as important (those used in tree splits). Using a single tree per trial (rather
    than the full ensemble) introduces diversity since different trees may emphasize
    different parameters.

    Args:
        kernel: The kernel to be autotuned.
        args: The arguments to be passed to the kernel during benchmarking.
        initial_population: Number of random configurations in initial population.
            Default from PATTERN_SEARCH_DEFAULTS. Ignored when using DEFAULT strategy.
        copies: Number of top configurations to run pattern search from.
            Default from PATTERN_SEARCH_DEFAULTS.
        max_generations: Maximum number of search iterations per copy.
            Default from PATTERN_SEARCH_DEFAULTS.
        min_improvement_delta: Early stopping threshold. Search stops if the relative
            improvement abs(best/current - 1) < min_improvement_delta.
            Default: 0.001 (0.1% improvement threshold).
        frac_selected: Fraction of generated neighbors to actually benchmark, after
            filtering by classifier score. Range: (0, 1]. Lower values reduce benchmarking
            cost but may miss good configurations. Default: 0.15.
        num_neighbors: Number of greedy tree traversal trials to run per generation.
            Each trial picks a random tree, traces its decision path, and greedily
            optimizes parameters along that path. Default: 100.
        radius: Maximum perturbation distance when generating pattern neighbors for
            each parameter during tree traversal. For power-of-two parameters, this
            is the max change in log2 space. For other parameters, this limits the
            neighborhood size. Default: 3.
        quantile: Threshold for labeling configs as "good" (class 1) vs "bad" (class 0).
            Configs with performance below this quantile are labeled as good.
            Range: (0, 1). Lower values create a more selective definition of "good".
            Default: 0.1 (top 10% are considered good).
        patience: Number of generations without improvement before stopping
            the search copy. Default: 1.
        similarity_penalty: Penalty for selecting points that are similar to points
            already selected in the batch. Default: 1.0.
        initial_population_strategy: Strategy for generating the initial population.
            FROM_RANDOM generates initial_population random configs.
            FROM_BEST_AVAILABLE uses cached configs from prior runs, and fills the
            remainder with random configs when best_available_pad_random is True.
            Can be overridden by HELION_AUTOTUNER_INITIAL_POPULATION env var.
        num_neighbors_cap: Maximum number of neighbors to explore per generation.
            -1 means no cap. Set HELION_CAP_AUTOTUNE_NUM_NEIGHBORS=N to override.
